      <h1>My software development journey so far</h1>
        <p>I have taken a number of basic HTML and CSS courses over the years but haven't ever learned 
          how to apply them until FAC introduced me to Github in September. I have designed and published 
          multiple websites over a number of years for work and for projects. My current website is a 
          profile and portfolio i use for my chef services and supper club events. It is hosted by Shopify 
          (add more).

          In September I began my software development journey. FAC set me up on Discord and Github. Sean
          gave me a crash course in command line, git and the terminal. I signed up to Codecademy and began 
          learning Javascript. Fast forward to November and i was ready to play JavaScript Codewars kata, build
          my first website and start learning about coding games.
        </p>
      <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p></p>
      <h1>Website</h1>
        <p>This website is built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. etc. </p>
      <h1>Game</h1>
        <p></p>
      
      <h1>What can i offer the course?</h1>
        <p></p>

      <h1>What would i like to achieve?</h1>
        <p>At this stage i have a number of ideas about how i want to apply the skills i develop on the FAC course. 
        DevOps, full-stack software engineering, cloud engineering and website development are some of them. 
        I also can't ignore the impact AI is having on the world and am looking for ways to incorporate this into my work.
