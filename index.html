    <p></p>

    <h1>What would i like to achieve?</h1>
    <p>At this stage i have a number of ideas about how i want to apply the skills i develop on the FAC course. 
        DevOps, full-stack engineering, Cloud engineering and website development are some of them. 
        I also can't ignore the impact AI is having on the world.
