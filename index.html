      <h1>My software development journey so far</h1>
        <p>I have taken a number of basic HTML and CSS courses over the years but haven't ever learned 
          how to apply them until FAC introduced me to Github in September. I have designed and published 
          multiple websites for work and for projects. My current website is a profile and portfolio i 
          use for my chef services and supper club events. It is hosted by Shopify. In the past i have 
          also hosted websites using Squarespace and Wordpress.

          In September I began my software development journey. FAC set me up on Discord and Github. Sean
          gave me a crash course in command line, git and the terminal. I signed up to Codecademy and began 
          two courses "Javascript" and "Build a Website with HTML, CSS and Github pages". Fast forward to 
          November and i was ready to play JavaScript Codewars kata, start building my first website and 
          start learning about coding games.
        </p>
      <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>Learning JavaScript in two months has been my biggest challenge with regards my application to FAC.
          I signed up to a Codecademy course (before i knew about the Freecodecamp courses) and put in 
          the hours to complete the course. You can view my certificate here. Next step: applying my new 
          JavaScript skills to Codewars kata. To begin with Codewars made no sense to me so i watched Youtube videos 
          of people solving JavaScript kata's. I would also use chat GPT in two ways: 1. Entering the entire kata
          when all else had failed and 2. breaking down the kata and asking chat GPT to help me with one step of the 
          kata. For example: 
        </p>
      <h1>Website</h1>
        <p>This website is built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. I always enjoyed designing websites and 
          I am loving now knowing which tools i need to put together a website without using a host platform.
        You can see I have used tables, colors, typography, display and positioning,  </p>
      <h1>Game</h1>
        <p></p>
      
      <h1>What can i offer the course?</h1>
        <p></p>

      <h1>What would i like to achieve?</h1>
        <p>At this stage i have a number of ideas about how i want to apply the skills i develop on the FAC course. 
        DevOps, full-stack software engineering, cloud engineering and website development are some of them. 
        I also can't ignore the impact AI is having on the world and am looking for ways to incorporate this into my work.
