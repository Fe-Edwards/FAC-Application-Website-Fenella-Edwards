    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> I am a chef looking for a career change in the direction of DevOps, Cloud Engineering, and Software Development. 
        I have always been interested in making websites and e-commerce. Thanks to FAC for helping me get started. 
        Since joining the FAC applicants sessions in September i have been learning to use my terminal, git and Github, 
        as well as studying Javascript with Codecademy.  
        I would like to join the Founders and Coders course to push my skills further and find my first role in software development.</p>

    <h1>What can i offer the course?</h1>
    <p></p>

    <h1>What would i like to achieve?</h1>
    <p>At this stage i have a number of ideas about how i want to apply the skills i develop on the FAC course. 
        DevOps, full-stack engineering, Cloud engineering and website development are some of them. 
        I also can't ignore the impact AI is having on the world.
